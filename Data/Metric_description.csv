https://wikirate.org/~1831908 , Does the company's statement name the suppliers in their supply chain and/or the geographic regions where their supply chain operates?,Researched,Walk Free,MSA supply chain disclosure,Multi-Category,Geographical;Facility/Supplier;No,Community Assessed,Most companies reporting under the UK Modern Slavery Act would have complex supply chains covering many countries and suppliers. It is therefore important that a company identifies or maps out their supply chain. Disclosing all suppliers and geographic regions within a modern slavery statement illustrates that a company is serious about assessing risks within their supply chain.,"This can include a list of the names of suppliers, or list of the specific countries or regions where goods are sourced. Some company statements include graphs or pie charts indicating where their company supply chain is based.

Please note this metric requires a list of the names of countries and/or suppliers, not a statement outlining the total number of countries or suppliers.

If the company specifies at least one region, country or area that feeds into their supply chain, the answer should be  Geographical.

If the company discloses a list of suppliers, the answer should be Facility/Supplier. If a company provides an active hyperlink to a list of named suppliers that is also sufficient for this answer option.

If the company specifies both a region, country or area AND a list of suppliers, then please select both values, Geographical and Facility/Supplier.

If no such disclosure exists, then please select No.

If companies identify production sites that are part of their own operations, those sites/factories are not considered to be suppliers."
https://wikirate.org/~1831932," Does the company's statement identify specific geographic regions (e.g. Indonesia), industries (e.g. agriculture), resources (e.g. Palm Oil) or types of workforce (e.g. migrant workers) where the risk of modern slavery is the greatest?", industries (e.g. agriculture), resources (e.g. Palm Oil) or types of workforce (e.g. migrant workers) where the risk of modern slavery is the greatest?,Researched,Walk Free,MSA Identification of risks,Multi-Category,Geographic;Industry;Resource/products and services;Workforce;In Development;No,"Does the company’s statement identify the greatest risks of modern slavery in its organisation and supply chain? The company must explicitly state the specific geographic regions, industries, resources or types of workforce where the risk is greatest.

The answer to this metric question may thus be one or several of these options:

Geographic - exposure may be greater in countries where protection against breaches of human rights are limited, particularly for migrant workers.

Industry - certain industries are more at risk of modern slavery than others. For example, those working in the extractives industry may differ to the risk in manufacturing. Risks linked to industries are of a more general nature than risks linked to specific resources, products or services.

Resource, products and services - some resources, products and services are more associated with modern slavery than others. For example, the extraction of mica or palm oil has been associated with high levels of debt bondage. Adult care services have been linked to rising modern slavery risks.

Workforce - some workers are more vulnerable to modern slavery than others. For example, temporary, seasonal or migrant workers may not be covered by local labour laws, or may not be as aware of their rights. Prisoners are also vulnerable to modern slavery. 

Please note this metric requires an explicit statement of the risk and where it occurs, it cannot apply to general statements about high levels of risk. Statements of a general nature are accepted, as long as the risks and the specific geographic regions, industries, resources/products/services or types of workforce are identified.

If a company lists countries or geographic regions (such as South Asia) where the risk of modern slavery is high, please select the “Geographic” value.

If a company identifies specific industries (such as the mining or apparel industry) where the risk of modern slavery is high, please select the “Industry” value.

If a company identifies specific resources (such as mica or palm oil) as being associated with modern slavery, please select the “Resource” value.

If a company describes a specific type of worker that is vulnerable to modern slavery, please select the “Workforce” value.

***Please select as many values as apply.***

If the business indicates if it will identify risks specific to modern slavery or is planning to do so in the future, please indicate “In Development”.

Where there are no details of specific risks, please give a “No” value."
https://wikirate.org/~2722057 ," Does the company's statement detail one or more specific, organisational policies or actions to combat slavery in their direct (tier 1) and/or in-direct (beyond tier 1) supply chain?",Researched,Walk Free,MSA policy (revised),Multi-Category,No;In Development;Suppliers comply with laws and company‚Äôs policies (direct / tier 1);Suppliers comply with laws and company‚Äôs policies (beyond tier 1);Prohibit use of forced labour (direct / tier 1);Prohibit use of forced labour (beyond tier 1);Code of conduct or supplier code includes clauses on slavery and human trafficking (direct / tier 1);Code of conduct or supplier code includes clauses on slavery and human trafficking (beyond tier 1);Contracts include clauses on forced labour (direct / tier 1);Contracts include clauses on forced labour (beyond tier 1);Suppliers produce their own statement (direct / tier 1);Suppliers produce their own statement (beyond tier 1);Prohibit charging of recruitment fees to employee (direct / tier 1);Prohibit charging of recruitment fees to employee (beyond tier 1);Prohibit use of child labour (direct / tier 1);Prohibit use of child labour (beyond tier 1);Suppliers protect migrant workers (direct / tier 1);Suppliers protect migrant workers (beyond tier 1);Suppliers respect labour rights (wages / freedom of association etc) (direct / tier 1);Suppliers respect labour rights (wages / freedom of association etc) (beyond tier 1),Community Assessed,"Establishing effective policies to combat modern slavery is listed as one potential component of a modern slavery statement within the UK Modern Slavery Act and is recommended by the Home Office guidance accompanying it. Clear organisational policies help to set the tone in assessing, preventing and mitigating the risk of, and working to influence and remedy, modern slavery in organisations and their own operations and supply chains. It also helps to demonstrate a companys commitment to tackling modern slavery.","These policies must be explicit and go beyond vague statements of intended actions. 

Direct supply chains can also be referred to as tier 1 supply chains and beyond tier 1 includes all players of the supply chain that are not directly tied to the company.

Policies can include:

requiring all suppliers and contractors to comply with local and international laws (including the UN Guiding Principles, ILO standards, or International Conventions), and companys policies,

prohibiting contractors or suppliers from using modern slavery, forced labour, involuntary labour, debt bondage or human trafficking,

prohibiting contractors or suppliers from using child labour,

including clauses on forced labour in Codes of Conduct or Supplier Codes,

requiring contracts to include clauses on forced labour in supply chains,

requiring all suppliers and contractors to respect labour rights more generally, such as paying living wages, or allowing freedom of association,

prohibiting all suppliers and contractors to charge employees fees as part of their recruitment,

requiring all suppliers and contractors to provide additional protection for migrant workers, or

requiring suppliers to produce their own statement on modern slavery and forced labour.

Please note this metric refers to organisational policies that are clear and explicitly tackle and prevent modern slavery. It does not measure supplier engagement such as supplier audits, questionnaires, site visits, etc., this is measured by the metrics: 'MSA risk assessment' and MSA risk management

Please select as many policies as apply. Distinguish whether these policies adhere to direct or Tier 1 suppliers or Tier 2 or beyond Tier 1 or in-direct suppliers. If it is not specifically mentioned which supply chain tiers these policies apply to, please assume they cover direct suppliers only. 

For example:

""all suppliers"" = direct / tier 1
""subcontractors"" = beyond tier 1
""monitoring tier suppliers 2 for compliance"" = beyond tier 1
If no such policy exists, then please select No.

If the business indicates it is developing a modern slavery supply chain policy or is planning to implement one in the future, please indicate In Development."
https://wikirate.org/~1831852, Was the company's Modern Slavery Act statement signed by an appropriate person?,Researched,Business & Human Rights Resource Centre,MSA statement signed,Category,Signed by CEO;Signed by Director;Signed by Managing Director;Signed by Chairman;Signed by other role;Signed - no title;Not signed,Community Assessed,The MSA requires that the statements are discussed at senior management level and signed by an appropriate senior member of the company (dependent on the type of company it is).,"Each statement should be signed by an appropriate senior member of the company. It does not require a physical signature, but the name of the person who has 'signed' the statement. These signatures are usually found at the beginning or the end of the document. This metric is asking who signed the company's statement.

The title and name of the individual who has 'signed' should be displayed. The possible values for this metric are as follows:

Signed by CEO

Signed by Director

Signed by Managing Director

Signed by Chairman

Signed by other role - where there is a signature by a named individual whose role is not covered by one of the above options. Please add a comment with the title of the individual who signed.

Signed - no title - where there is a signature by a named individual but no description of their role. Please add a comment with the name of the individual who signed.

Not signed - where no individual has signed the statement.

NOTE: Signature is not the same as approval- this is covered under the metric MSA Statement Approval

If the statement is signed by more than one person, please prioritise the following roles in your selection: CEO, Director, Managing Director, or Chairman. If it is signed by multiple people with any of those titles, please select one."
https://wikirate.org/~2722223, How does the company assess the risks of modern slavery and trafficking in their supply chain?,Researched,Walk Free,MSA risk assessment,Multi-Category,Risk-based questionnaires;Use of risk management tool or software;Conducting desk research including information from third parties/NGO's;In Development;No,Community Assessed,"After mapping out their supply chain, a company must then assess the risk of modern slavery occurring within it. This enables the company to take targeted action against modern slavery. This assessment can take place as part of an organisations wider approach to risk, but should be proportionate the companys size, structure, location of supply chains and nature of business."," This metric asks how a company assesses risks, not which risks it has identified. The risk assessment tools must be specific to modern slavery and go beyond general tools related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

This can include:

Requiring all new suppliers to complete risk-based questionnaires. If the company reports conducting employee interviews as part of its risk assessment process, this would also fall under ""Risk-based questionnaires"".

The use of a specified risk management database or tool, such as Maplecroft or Sedex, or

Conducting research to assess risk, for example using existing research such as the Global Slavery Index, the Corruption Perception Index, Human Rights Watch reports, Amnesty International Reports or reports produced by the UN.

Please note this metric refers to the tools or mechanisms that companys use to assess risk. Identifying where risk is highest is covered under the metric: MSA Identification of risks

*Select as many examples of training as apply:

Risk-based questionnaires if a company outlines that it requires suppliers or workers to complete questions 
Use of risk management tool or software if a company describes a tool, such as a risk matrix, or the use of software such as maplecroft or sedex.
Conducting research if a company describes conducting its own research into its supply chain
In Development if the business indicates it is developing risk management tools specific to modern slavery or planning to implement one in the future, please indicate 
Select No where there are no details of risk assessment strategies."
https://wikirate.org/~1827915 , Was the company's Modern Slavery Act statement explicitly approved by the board of directors (or equivalent management body)?,Researched,Business & Human Rights Resource Centre,MSA Statement Approval,Category,Approval not explicit in statement;Approved by Board;Approved - not by Board,,"The MSA requires that the statements are discussed at senior management level and approved by the Board of Directors, Members, or Partners (who signs it is dependent on the type of company it is). This ensures senior level accountability, leadership and responsibility for modern slavery and gives it the serious attention it deserves.

A board of directors (B of D) is a group of individuals that are elected as, or elected to act as, representatives of the stockholders to establish corporate management related policies and to make decisions on major company issues.

A member must sign when it is a limited liability partnership. A member is a partner in a business who is only liable for the money they invest in the business, not the business or other partners.

A partner must sign when it is a limited partnership, or any other type of organisation. Partners have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits and have joint and liability for debts of the partnership.","Approval for the statement can usually be found near the end of the document. If the statement has been explicitly approved by some entity or person other than the board of directors, please select ""Approved - not by Board"" and add the relevant sentence as a comment on your value. If no explicit approval can be found choose the ""Approval not explicit in statement"" value.

NOTE: explicit approval is not the same as signature - this is covered under the metric MSA Statement Signed.

If the entity has a sole director and the report names the sole director and clearly states that the statement has been approved by that individual as the Sole Director, please select ""Approved by Board""."
https://wikirate.org/~1831964 , Has the company identified at least one incident related to modern slavery risks?,Researched,Walk Free,MSA incidents identified,Multi-Category,Modern slavery;Recruitment fees;Freedom of movement;Wages and benefits;Working Hours;Working conditions;Other incidents;No,,"Given the size of the problem and the complex and far-reaching nature of the supply chains of large companies, it is perhaps not surprising that incidents of modern slavery in supply chains can be common. Companies should present an accurate picture rather than seeking to cover up problems. Revealing these incidents in their statements shows business partners and consumers that companies are taking the issue seriously, and have effective risk assessment strategies in place.","Incident (violations, non-compliances) is defined as a case study or description of any case of violation of the company policies or local laws involving an individual or group of individuals. Companies can identify different types of violations, ranging from modern slavery cases to other types of incidents, such as health and safety or payment of recruitment fees. 

Because definitions of modern slavery vary, incidents described in modern slavery statements (e.g. recruitment fees) do not always qualify as cases of modern slavery or forced labour, even though they are often considered as indicators or risk factors. This is why we are trying to capture the different categories of incidents disclosed by companies. 

Please note, the incident must refer to a specific example, not a general description of risk, which is covered by the metric 'MSA Identification of risks'. 

The answer options are the following: 

Modern slavery: cases of forced labour, child labour, state-imposed forced labour. The statement must refer to cases of modern slavery that the company recognizes as such, not to cases in which the company has identified a risk of modern slavery. 

Recruitment fees: cases in which workers paid fees to agencies or brokers for recruitment and placement in jobs, abuse of debt, and deposits.

Freedom of movement and association: passport confiscation, restrictions on freedom of movement, confinement at workplace, prohibition of workers association. 

Wages and benefits: underpayment, withholding of wages, unpaid overtime, wages under the legal minimum or living wage level, and wage deductions. 

Working Hours: working hours above the legal maximum, excessive overtime, mandatory overtime. 

Working conditions: hazardous/unsafe conditions, health issues caused by work, workplace abuse and harassment.

Other incidents: data protection, discrimination, or incidents that are mentioned but not described

No: If the company did not identify any incidents, or there is no relevant information in the statement, give them a value of No."
https://wikirate.org/~2722458 , Does the company describe a grievance mechanism to facilitate whistle-blowing or the reporting of suspected incidents of slavery or trafficking?,Researched,Walk Free,MSA whistleblowing mechanism (revised),Multi-Category,"Hotline, Email, Contact Form (direct employees);Hotline, Email, Contact Form (supply chain workers);Whistleblower protection (direct employees);Whistleblower protection (supply chain workers);Focal Point (direct employees);Focal Point (supply chain workers);In Development (direct employees);In Development (supply chain workers);No",Community Assessed,"Businesses should provide a hotline or other grievance mechanism so that anyone part of or witness to their operations and supply chains may report or flag suspected incidents of slavey or trafficking. As part of business responsibility to respect workers rights, those affected by modern slavery and those witnessing violations in any part of a companys operations should be able to freely report incidents. These mechanisms should be clear and transparent, and any incidents should be recorded and monitored. ","A whistleblowing mechanisms may include:

A reporting line or hotline that workers can call (reporting managed by third parties, or reporting platforms like a 'Speak Up' tool, not policy, fall in this category too) 

Whistleblower protections for employees so they will not be penalised if they report modern slavery cases (mention of any kind of protection is sufficient e.g. ""we ensure that anyone raising such concern will not suffer dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment as a result"" ). If the disclosure specifies that grievances can be reported anonymously or confidentially, that also is sufficient for this answer option. Key words: Retaliation, repercussions, fear, reprisal, detriment 

An employee or independent focal point to whom reports can be made. A focal point is in place permanently. If the statement states that reports of violations can be shared with auditors or other personnel operating at the company on a temporary basis, they would not qualify as a focal point.

A direct employee is someone who is working directly for the company either in the company head office or in regional offices.

A supply chain worker is someone who is employed by contractors or sub-contractors further down the supply chain.

For many companies the risk of forced labour is much greater within their supply chain rather than in their own operations - as such the provision of a mechanism that extends to workers within the companys supply chain is regarded as a positive step.

Please select as many mechanisms as apply.

NOTE: 'Speak Up' or any other policy can be sufficient to meet the answer 'Hotline, Email, Contact Form' if details are provided specifying how workers' concerns can be raised. If it is not explicitly stated, it cannot be assumed.

Where there is no mention in the statement of who the mechanism applies to, please assume it applies only to direct employees.

If the business indicates it is developing a whistleblowing or grievance mechanism or planning to implement one in the future, please indicate In Development and again give details in the comments section.

Please select ""No"" if no whistleblowing mechanism is described in the statement."
https://wikirate.org/~2722444 ," In the modern slavery statement, does the company explain one or more of the corrective steps it has taken (or would take) in response to modern slavery incidents in their operations and/or supply chain?",Researched,Walk Free,MSA incidents remediation (revised),Multi-Category,Worker remediation;Corrective action plan;Senior management;Cancel contracts;In Development;Remediation is mentioned but no details of the process or measures;No,Community Assessed,"Should a company find instances of modern slavery in its own operations and/or supply chain, the company has a responsibility to respect the human rights of those affected, and should take steps to investigate and provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes (UN Guiding Principles). This can include taking collaborative approaches, such as working with the supplier to tackle the problem through corrective action plans, or more punitive action such as cancelling contracts with the supplier. Working with suppliers will help to prevent such instances occurring in the future and will reinforce respect for human rights throughout the supply chain.

Remediation policies can be in place regardless of whether incidents have been identified. Where the company has identified at least one incident of slavery, this question can be answered in relation to their response to those incidents.

Where the company has not identified any incidents of slavery, this question should be answered based on whether they describe a clear plan or policy for remediating such incidents should they be identified in future.","Examples of corrective steps include:

Providing remediation direct to the worker affected (backpayment of wages, support to prosecute or pursue a civil claim etc)

Informing senior management of instances of modern slavery
